fly16
=====

_fly16_ is a syntax highlighting theme for the
[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) utility that is designed to match the
[moonfly](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors) &
[nightfly](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-nightfly-guicolors) Vim/Neovim
colorschemes (and associated terminal themes).

_fly16_ is a derivation of the _bat_'s existing _base16_ theme but with specific
tweaks to better match both _moonfly_ and _nightfly_, especially when used as a
previewer with the [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) plugin.

Installation
------------

Copy or symlink `fly16.tmTheme` to `~/.config/bat/themes` followed by `bat cache
--build`.

Then select
[fly16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluz71/fly16-bat/master/fly16.tmTheme)
as your preferred _bat_ theme.
