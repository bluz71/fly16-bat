fly16
=====

_fly16_ is a color theme for the [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) utility
that is designed to match the
[moonfly](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors) and
[nightfly](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-nightfly-guicolors) Vim and terminal
colorschemes.

_fly16_ is a derivation of the _bat_'s existing _base16_ theme but with tweaks
to better match both _moonfly_ and _nightfly_, especially when used with the
[fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) plugin

Installation
------------

Copy or symlink `fly16.tmTheme` to `~/.config/bat/themes` followed by `bat cache
--build`.

Then select the `fly16` as your preferred _bat_ theme.
